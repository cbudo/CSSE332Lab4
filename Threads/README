THREADS

This multithreaded program sorts integer values from an input file in ascending order. The program uses three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and "Brute Force" sort. A makefile is included to compile this program.

To run the "threads" program, you must provide three command-line arguments in the following order:
1. The number of threads to create, and integer value
2. The name of an input file containing newline-separated integer values
3. The name of an output file

The output file will contain the input values in sorted order.
